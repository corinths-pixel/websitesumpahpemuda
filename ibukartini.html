      <p class="header p">
        Raden Adjeng Kartini, also known as Raden Ayu Kartini (21 April 1879 – 17 September 1904), was a prominent Indonesian advocate of women's rights and female education.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="header p">
She was born into an aristocratic Javanese family in the Dutch East Indies (present-day Indonesia). Instead, Kartini entered a period of seclusion mandated for teenage girls until they married. She opposed the Purdah-like seclusion of teenage girls and polygamy.

    She met various officials and influential people, including J.H. Abendanon. She began the tradition amongst three of her sisters to found and operate schools. After she died, schools were established by a foundation founded in the Netherlands. Some of her Indonesian friends also established Kartini Schools. After her death, her sisters continued her advocacy of educating girls and women. Kartini's letters were published in a Dutch magazine and eventually, in 1911, as the works: Door Duisternis tot Licht (From Dark Comes Light) and an English version, Letters of a Javanese Princess.
