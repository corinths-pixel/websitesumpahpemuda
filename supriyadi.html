        Fransiskus Xaverius Soeprijadi, also known as Supriyadi or Soeprijadi (born 13 April 1923, disappeared 14 February 1945, declared dead 9 August 1975), was an Indonesian national hero who rebelled against the occupying Japanese in 1945. </p>
    <br>
    <p class="header p">
Supriyadi was born in Trenggalek on 13 April 1923. He attended junior high school, then a training school for civil service in Magelang. However, the Japanese invaded Indonesia before he graduated. He then switched to high school and underwent youth training (Seimendoyo) in Tangerang, West Java.

 <p class="header p">
    In October 1943, the Japanese established a militia, PETA (Indonesian: Pembela Tanah Air, lit. 'Defenders of the Homeland') to assist Japanese forces against the Allies. Supriyadi joined PETA, and after training was posted to Blitar. He was tasked with overseeing the work of the Romusha forced laborers. The plight of these workers inspired him to rebel against the Japanese. When Supriyadi joined PETA, he was given the rank of shodancho or platoon commander.
