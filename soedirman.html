        Raden Soedirman (born 24 January 1916, died 29 January 1950) was an Indonesian national hero who led the armed struggle against the Dutch during the Indonesian National Revolution despite suffering from tuberculosis(lung disease). </p>

          After leaving teacher`s college, he started working as a teacher in 1936 and later became the headmaster of a Muhammadiyah elementary school. When the Japanese took control of the Indies in 1942, Sudirman continued teaching until he joined the Japanese-backed Defenders of the Homeland, or PETA, as a battalion commander in Banyumas in 1944. On November 12, 1945, Sudirman was picked as the military's commander-in-chief in a close vote in Yogyakarta, beating Oerip Soemohardjo. While waiting for official confirmation, Sudirman ordered an attack on British and Dutch forces in Ambarawa. The battle resulted in the British withdrawing, which boosted Sudirman's support among the people, and he was finally confirmed as commander-in-chief on December 18.

          Sudirman and a small contingent escaped Dutch forces and left the city, making their headquarters at Sobo, near Mount Lawu. There Sudirman commanded military activities throughout Java, including a show of force in Yogyakarta on 1 March 1949. When the Dutch began withdrawing, in July 1949 Sudirman was recalled to Yogyakarta and forbidden to fight further. In late 1949 Sudirman's tuberculosis relapsed, and he retired to Magelang, where he died slightly more than a month after the Dutch recognised Indonesia's independence.
